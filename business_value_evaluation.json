    "Business Value Evaluation": "### Business Value Evaluation ###\n\n*   *Uniqueness:* The idea of AR-based car maintenance assistance is not entirely novel, but the focus on average-skilled users and integration of multiple features like tele-assistance and maintenance checklists could offer some differentiation. The markerless AR approach and specific ML/CV techniques employed would need to be genuinely innovative to establish a strong unique selling proposition.\n\n*   *Market Usefulness:* The problem statement clearly articulates a user need: car owners struggle with basic maintenance and understanding car features, preferring readily accessible graphical instructions over traditional manuals. The system's aim to empower owners, reduce reliance on professionals for minor issues, and improve vehicle understanding aligns well with current consumer trends.\n\n*   *Feasibility:* The SRS outlines clear objectives and scope, including component detection, instruction overlay, safety considerations, and tele-assistance features. While ambitious, the reliance on established technologies like AR, CV, and ML suggests technical feasibility, but successful implementation hinges on accurate and robust component detection and user-friendly instruction design.\n\n*   *Profitability:* The large market size (new car sales) and potential for cost savings for car owners create a foundation for profitability. Monetization could involve a freemium model, partnerships with car manufacturers, or premium features like expert assistance, but a detailed business plan is needed to assess long-term financial viability.\n\n*Overall Business Value Rating:* 7\n\n*Category:* High\n"
